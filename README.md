## üìä Dataset
The dataset includes detailed statistics for:
- **Players Analyzed:** 216 players.
- **Teams Included:** 16 NBA teams.

### Metrics Analyzed
- **Player Statistics:** 
  - Points per Game (PPG), Assists per Game (APG), Rebounds per Game (RPG), Blocks per Game (BPG), Steals per Game (SPG).
- **Team Performance:** 
  - Points per Game, Average Age, and Efficiency Metrics (eFG%, TS%, 3P%).

## ‚ùì Key Questions Answered
The dashboard addresses the following critical questions:
1. Which teams and players performed best during the season?
2. How do shooting efficiencies (TS%, eFG%) differ across players and teams?
3. What are the average performance rates for players (PPG, RPG, APG, etc.)?
4. How are players categorized by performance status (High vs. Low Performers)?
5. What is the age and experience distribution of players across teams?
